# Leo McGarry task Manager

This application was created for the ficticous Leo McGarry, the White House Chief of Staff from the TV series "The West Wing". It was created for the purpose of being able to keep track of the tasks that Leo has assigned to his staff ( this is fully interchangeable for other purposes, such as keeping track of chores in a shared flat, or more broadly as a manager keeping track of the employees tasks). 

The user is able to create a new employee ( or Flatmate) , create new tasks, delete tasks, and remove employees ( or other creations)  from the database. 

All this is able to be done without having to refresh the page. 

This gems dependencies include Ruby, Active-Record, amongst others.

These will be installed upon "bundle install" being entered into in the temrinal.
